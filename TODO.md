# Intro

We see 4 fundamental task categories

1. fixing PS (PlaySound) to be **ng6+** compatible and easy to develop and maintain
2. adding features you need (sessions, extended chat, remote playing)
3. describing methodologies
    + this is something that is not code-related, but rather new use cases
    + like the one we did for PTW, program music, etc, that were done with the current PS
4. extension of PS to support more advanced use-cases and methodologies that you/we anticipate
    + this will help us to encode methodologies (3. category) in a more controlled way
    + this will help us with more advanced methodologies
5. adding semantic layer
    1. **RIMA tagging**
        1. allowing personalization of ***soundscape*** and communication
    2. **CoLaboFlow** descriptions of the processes
        1. to enable and understand interaction in more complex events (multidisciplinary/multimedia/theatre/performance/public events support)
        2. enable **time-wise** description of PlaySound events and management

## Migrating to modern Angular (6+)

+ Create a working hybrid project
+ It will keep regular working version of original project, but wrapped in `ng6+` container
+ it will **lower development and maintenance time**
+ We can then program in much healthier environment with much cleaner code and structure
+ We can add ***Colabo.space puzzles*** (components/packages)
+ We can still use old code within new code, and new code within old code, so no pain
+ You can still continue to program in old AngularJS, but that is not recommended :)
+ we can incrementally migrate to new code

## Provide Audio Commons access

+ Integrate Javascript library for access to the Audio Commons ecosystem

## Advance Models of pseudo-real-time performance

+ Queued/Delayed/Pseudo real-time performance
+ Component for designing sounds queue with parameters

## Advanced Models of real-time performance

+ Colabo.Space : TopiChat
    + Support for sessions
    + Support for chat
    + references to entities (sounds) from chat

## Integration with Art & Science Use Cases

+ Integrate with artistic usecases through Colabo.Space ecosystem
+ Usecases
    + [CoLaboArthon](http://cha-os.org/colaboarthon/)
    + [Poetry on the Road](http://colabo.space/colaboarthon/poetry_on_the_road/)
    + DialoGame

### Everydays Heroes (Dresden, Germany)

+ TBD

### Performance at PTW (New York, USA)

#### In a nutshell

+ we are using **collaborative augmentation** Tools and Methodologies (articulated through  [Colabo.space](http://colabo.space/)) to help building and rolling **the wheel (a dialogue) between Science->Art->Society**
+ We are starting with **D.C.Engelbart vision** of Collective Intelligence and and ***UN SDGs*** transforming it into a practice with international practitioners of **Performance Activism**
+ We want to offer a great **opportunity of pseudo-real-time performance** for the Open Band at this event, and producing a program music for each performer's performance and performances' fusions
+ We will aim to do ***awareness initiation*** and **psycho-behavioral matching** between musicians and performers to find the best matches. We will do it online with **AI augmented NLP tools @ Colabo.Space**
+ We will **credit work** of PlaySound, Open Band, Audio Common projects and teams

#### More Details

+ PlaySound **Integration with Art & Science** Use Cases
+ [PTW (Perform The World) Conference](http://www.performingtheworld.org/who-we-are), New York, 21-23. September
+ Founded by ***Patch Adams*** and few other key players in Performance Activism - ***East Side Institute***, New York, and  ***All Stars Project***, New York
    + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Adams
      + [film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Adams_(film)) with Robin Williams
      + http://www.patchadams.org/
    + https://allstars.org/
    + http://eastsideinstitute.org/
+ Our workshop is focused on [ColaboArthon](http://cha-os.org/colaboarthon/) methodology and [Colabo.space](http://colabo.space/) augmentation technology
+ We are starting with **Science and facts**: [UN SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) and [Douglas C Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart) as futurist, father of GroupWare, computer collaborative augmentation and Collective Intelligence
+ We use (*ColaboArthon, CoEvoLudens, DialoGame*) methodologies augmented with Colabo.Space to translate it into artistic, performing and moving aspect, and using [Vygotsky's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Vygotsky)  *"[A Head Taller](https://www.joanwink.com/vision-of-vygotsky/vision-of-vygotsky-children-at-play-through-page-115/)"* methodology to learn **collectiveness** by playing, to start ***co-evolution*** and to transform a vision of ***Collective Mind*** into action

#### Methodologies/Tools

We have **methodologies/tools (online/offline)** that participants do at the beginning of work and they help us to understand who ***matches*** whom, to ***tune*** them, and potentially what ***psychological profile*** they are. 

Some of them are text expressions in a free form, so we use ***NLP*** and ***AI*** tools to analyze them

**Offline tools**: we use various, most of them are team building methodologies, some of them we designed as **collective awareness** and ***collective emotional intelligence*** building , where participants in the room are interacting with each others, talking, physical interaction, etc

**Online tools** (that we used at the PTW conference):

+ we were using first **offline awareness** and then 
+ online (mobile) **SDG selections** ([UN SDGs](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/), there is in the TODO), and then we are matching them by their selections and clustering in groups
+ online (mobile) **CWC (Coaching with Compassion) dreaming** (textual) and then using AI + NLP tools to math it, extract topics
+ later we **augment online+offline DialoGame** with AI findings from CWC and SDGs
+ by playing the performative dialogue (DialoGame), performers decorate their playing cards (chunks of performance) with **emoticons** (8 basic emotions by Plutchik) and based on this, we <u>match</u> their performances with the creations from ***PlaySound*** 

This is a brief explanation if that helps, I can eventually elaborate more or demonstrate
